To do:

- Update old examples

- Test Houdini-To-Monkey model pipeline
		
- Environment component
	- Env Color
	- Env texture
	- Ambient light
	- Bg Color
	- Bg Texture

Done!

- Width/Height echo should report true window size
- Investigate
	- Mojo Physics
		- Ray cast
	- Project a point from 3d to 2d
- BaseObject Component? Would include name, transforms, tags, etc.
- Material lookup by name? Would allow sharing of materials, no need for material components.
	- Another solution: material component that looks up a material by name... :-)
- Component .json
	-Loading object arrays returns empty - fixed
	-Components need "deep" serialization (include super class parameters) - fixed
- Rename OnCreate to something more clear? OnAssign? OnAdded?
- Break Load and Save functions per class:
	- Get rid of DeserializeGameObjects, Use GameObject.Load
	- Get rid of MaterialLibrary.Save and Load, use Material.Load, Material.Save, Texture.Load, Texture.Save
